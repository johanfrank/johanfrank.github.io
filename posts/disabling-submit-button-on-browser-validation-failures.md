# Disabling submit button on browser validation failures

Disabling your submit button in your HTML form, so your users can't accidentally post the same contents more than once, is quite simple using Alpine.js.
Lets just bind a `@click` to a simple boolean model and have that toggle:

```html
<form name="myForm" x-data="{ disabled: false }">
    <input name="first_name" type="text" required>
    <input type="submit" x-bind:disabled="disabled" @click="disabled = !disabled">
</form>
```

Really simple... until you forget to fill out that required form! But oh the state is messy. And you don't want to skip the browser validation right... ðŸ˜©

Luckily there's a [Constraint Validation API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms/Form_validation#the_constraint_validation_api) available in modern browsers! And as long as your form is named you can access this through `document.forms`, and hey presto there's even a method that returns `true` if all your form elements are valid:

```html
<form name="myForm" x-data="{ disabled: false }">
    <input name="first_name" type="text" required>
    <input type="submit" x-bind:disabled="disabled" @click="disabled = document.forms.myForm.checkVal
</form>
```
